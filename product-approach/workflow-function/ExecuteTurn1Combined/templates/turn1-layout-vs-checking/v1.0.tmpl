The FIRST image provided ALWAYS depicts the Reference Layout of the vending machine.

This image shows how the vending machine should be arranged according to the approved planogram.

Focus exclusively on analyzing this reference layout image in detail. Your goal is to identify the exact contents of all {{.RowCount}} rows ({{.RowLabels}}) and {{.ColumnCount}} slots per row.

Important reminders:

1. Row identification is CRITICAL - Row {{index .RowLabels 0}} is ALWAYS the topmost physical shelf, Row {{index .RowLabels (add .RowCount -1)}} is ALWAYS the bottommost physical shelf.

2. Be thorough and descriptive in your analysis of each row status (Full/Partial/Empty).

3. DO NOT compare with any other image at this stage - just analyze this Reference Layout Image.

We will perform comparison with the checking image in the next step.
