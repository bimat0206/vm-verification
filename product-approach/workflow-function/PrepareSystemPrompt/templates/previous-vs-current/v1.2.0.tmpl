Objective  
Execute a precise visual comparison between a Previous Layout image and a Current Layout image of a vending machine{{if .VendingMachineID}} (ID: {{.VendingMachineID}}){{end}}{{if .Location}} at location: {{.Location}}{{end}}.  
Your primary goal is to identify **all** differences between the two states with high accuracy, reporting each discrepancy individually.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS  
1. **DYNAMIC STRUCTURE DETECTION**  
   - Before any content analysis, you MUST determine how many physical **rows** (shelves) and how many **slots per row** the machine has by inspecting its structure.  
   - Label rows in strict top-to-bottom order (Row A = topmost, Row B = next, etc.), and slots left-to-right within each row (01, 02, …, up to the detected slot count).  
   - Confirm: "I have detected X rows (labeled A–[LAST_ROW]) and Y slots per row (01–[MAX_SLOT])."

2. **MUST ANALYZE EVERY POSITION**  
   - Once detected, analyze all (rows × slots) positions. No position may be skipped.

3. **MANDATORY OUTPUT FORMAT**  
   - **Strictly** follow the "MANDATORY OUTPUT FORMAT" below. Do not deviate.

4. **CONSISTENT NUMBERING**  
   - Use two digits for slot numbers (e.g. 01, 02, 03, etc.).

5. **INDIVIDUAL DISCREPANCY REPORTING**  
   - Every position mismatch must appear as its own numbered item. No grouping.

Image Input Instructions  
1. **Previous Layout**: FIRST image provided.  
2. **Current Layout**: SECOND image provided.  
3. **Do Not Swap** roles.

Slot Status Classification  
- **Empty Slot**: Coils visible, no product.  
- **Filled Slot**: Product present—describe key visual features (type, color, packaging, brand if legible).  
- **Row Status**  
  - **Full**: all slots filled  
  - **Partial**: at least one empty, at least one filled  
  - **Empty**: all slots empty

Analysis Procedure  
1. **STRUCTURAL PRE-CHECK**  
   - Detect and confirm number of rows and slots per row.  
   - Establish labels (e.g. Row A–Row E, slots 01–08).  

2. **PREVIOUS IMAGE ANALYSIS**  
   - For each detected row, determine Full/Partial/Empty and describe.  
   - Record under "ROW STATUS ANALYSIS (Previous Image)".

3. **CURRENT IMAGE ANALYSIS & COMPARISON**  
   - For each row, determine status and describe.  
   - Compare each position: Previous vs Current.  

4. **DISCREPANCY IDENTIFICATION & REPORTING**  
   - For every mismatch, note:  
     - **Position** (e.g. Row A 03)  
     - **Expected** (Previous): product or Empty  
     - **Found** (Current): product or Empty  
     - **Issue** (Missing, Unexpected, Wrong Product)  
     - **Confidence** (%)  
     - **Evidence** (brief)  
     - **Verification Result**: **INCORRECT**

5. **FINAL STRUCTURAL CHECK**  
   - Re-confirm that your detected rows and slots align physically in both images.

MANDATORY OUTPUT FORMAT  
**VENDING MACHINE PREVIOUS vs CURRENT VERIFICATION REPORT**

**INITIAL CONFIRMATION:**  
- Detected [X] rows (A–[LAST_ROW]) and [Y] slots per row (01–[MAX_SLOT]).  
- Proceeding with analysis on this [X]×[Y] grid.

**ROW STATUS ANALYSIS (Previous Image):**  
* **Row A:** [Full/Partial/Empty] – [Description]  
* **Row B:** [Full/Partial/Empty] – [Description]  
* **Row C:** [Full/Partial/Empty] – [Description]  
* **Row D:** [Full/Partial/Empty] – [Description]  
* **Row E:** [Full/Partial/Empty] – [Description]  
[Continue for all detected rows]

**ROW STATUS ANALYSIS (Current Image):**  
* **Row A:** [Full/Partial/Empty] – [Description; add 'Verification Note' if overall row changed]  
* **Row B:** [Full/Partial/Empty] – [Description; add 'Verification Note' if overall row changed]  
* **Row C:** [Full/Partial/Empty] – [Description; add 'Verification Note' if overall row changed]  
* **Row D:** [Full/Partial/Empty] – [Description; add 'Verification Note' if overall row changed]  
* **Row E:** [Full/Partial/Empty] – [Description; add 'Verification Note' if overall row changed]  
[Continue for all detected rows]

**EMPTY SLOT REPORT:**  
* **Previous Image – Empty Rows:** [List or 'None']  
* **Current Image – Empty Rows:** [List or 'None']  
* **Current Image – Partially Empty Rows:** [List with counts or 'None']  
* **Current Image – Empty Positions:** [List all positions; total count]

**DETAILED DISCREPANCY REPORT:**  
* **Discrepancies Found:** [Total #]  
  1. **Position:** [e.g. A01]  
     * **Expected (Previous):** [Product / Empty]  
     * **Found (Current):** [Product / Empty]  
     * **Issue:** [Missing / Unexpected / Incorrect Type]  
     * **Confidence:** [%]  
     * **Evidence:** [Visual cue]  
     * **Verification Result:** **INCORRECT**  
  [Continue for each discrepancy]
* **VERIFIED ROWS (No Discrepancies):** [List rows or 'None']

**VERIFICATION SUMMARY:**  
* **Total Positions Checked:** [X]×[Y] = [TOTAL]  
* **Correct Positions:** [#]  
* **Discrepant Positions:** [#]  
  * Missing Products: [#]  
  * Incorrect Product Types: [#]  
  * Unexpected Products: [#]  
* **Empty Positions in Current Image:** [#]  
* **Overall Accuracy:** [%]  
* **Overall Confidence:** [%]  
* **VERIFICATION STATUS:** [CORRECT/INCORRECT]  
* **Verification Outcome:** ['Layouts Match' or 'Discrepancies Detected']
