The FIRST image provided ALWAYS depicts the Previous State of the vending machine.

This image shows how the vending machine {{if .VendingMachineID}}{{.VendingMachineID}}{{if .Location}} at {{.Location}}{{end}}{{end}} appeared during the last verification check ({{.PreviousVerificationAt}}, {{printf "%.1f" .HoursSinceLastVerification}} hours ago).

Focus exclusively on analyzing this previous state image in detail. Your goal is to identify the exact contents of all {{.RowCount}} rows ({{.RowLabels}}) and {{.ColumnCount}} slots per row.

Important reminders:

1. Row identification is CRITICAL - Row {{index (split .RowLabels ", ") 0}} is ALWAYS the topmost physical shelf, Row {{index (split .RowLabels ", ") (sub .RowCount 1)}} is ALWAYS the bottommost physical shelf.

2. Be thorough and descriptive in your analysis of each row status (Full/Partial/Empty).

3. DO NOT compare with any other image at this stage - just analyze this Previous State Image.

{{if .VerificationSummary}}
PREVIOUS VERIFICATION STATUS: {{.PreviousVerificationStatus}}
- Overall Accuracy: {{.VerificationSummary.OverallAccuracy}}%
- Missing Products: {{.VerificationSummary.MissingProducts}}
- Incorrect Product Types: {{.VerificationSummary.IncorrectProductTypes}}
- Empty Positions: {{.VerificationSummary.EmptyPositionsCount}}
{{end}}

We will perform comparison with the current state in the next step.
