The SECOND image provided ALWAYS depicts the **Current Layout** of the vending machine.

Your task is to compare this Current Layout image with the **Previous Layout** that you analyzed in Turn 1. Identify **all** discrepancies between the two states.

Important reminders:

1. **Row & Slot Identification Is CRITICAL**  
   - Use the exact same row labels and slot numbers you confirmed in Turn 1.
   - Do **not** re-detect structure here—reuse the detected grid.

2. **Be Thorough and Descriptive**  
   - **Missing Products**: present in Previous but absent in Current  
   - **Unexpected Products**: absent in Previous but present in Current  
   - **Incorrect Product Types**: product in Current differs from Previous at the same position  
   - **Empty Slots**: slots that should have products but now show coils

3. **For Each Discrepancy, Clearly State:**  
   - **Position:** e.g. A01  
   - **Expected (Previous):** product name or “Empty (coils visible)”  
   - **Found (Current):** product name or “Empty (coils visible)”  
   - **Issue:** Missing / Unexpected / Incorrect Product  
   - **Confidence:** e.g. 92%  
   - **Evidence:** brief visual cue or detail  
   - **Verification Result:** **INCORRECT**

4. **Verification Outcome**  
   - **CORRECT** – if Current Layout matches Previous exactly  
   - **INCORRECT** – if there is **any** discrepancy

5. **If INCORRECT**, list each discrepancy in a numbered, structured format for easy tracking.

We will then generate the **VERIFICATION SUMMARY** based on your findings.
