The SECOND image provided shows the Current State of the vending machine.

This image shows how the vending machine {{if .VendingMachineID}}{{.VendingMachineID}}{{if .Location}} at {{.Location}}{{end}}{{end}} appears now during this verification check.

Your task is to compare this Current State image with the Previous State that you analyzed in Turn 1. Identify any changes or discrepancies between the Previous State and the Current State.

Important reminders:

1. Row identification is CRITICAL - Row {{index .RowLabels 0}} is ALWAYS the topmost physical shelf, Row {{index .RowLabels (add .RowCount -1)}} is ALWAYS the bottommost physical shelf.

2. Be thorough and descriptive in your comparison, focusing on:
   - Products that have been removed since the Previous State
   - Products that have been added since the Previous State
   - Products that have been moved to different positions
   - Changes in fill levels or product arrangements

3. For each discrepancy, clearly state:
   - The product name
   - Where it was in the Previous State
   - Where it is now (or if it's been removed)

4. At the end of your analysis, provide a verification outcome:
   - CORRECT: If the Current State shows expected changes (e.g., restocking, planned reorganization)
   - INCORRECT: If there are unexpected or concerning changes

5. If INCORRECT, list all discrepancies in a structured format for easy tracking.
