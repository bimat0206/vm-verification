The SECOND image provided shows the Current State of the vending machine.

This image shows how the vending machine {{if .VendingMachineID}}{{.VendingMachineID}}{{end}}{{if .Location}} at {{.Location}}{{end}} appears now during this verification check.

Your task is to compare this Current State image with the Reference Layout that you analyzed in Turn 1. Identify any discrepancies between the Reference Layout and the Current State.

Important reminders:

1. Row identification is CRITICAL - Row {{index .RowLabels 0}} is ALWAYS the topmost physical shelf, Row {{index .RowLabels (add .RowCount -1)}} is ALWAYS the bottommost physical shelf.

2. Be thorough and descriptive in your comparison, focusing on:
   - Missing products (products in Reference Layout but not in Current State)
   - Misplaced products (products in wrong positions)
   - Empty slots that should contain products

3. For each discrepancy, clearly state:
   - The product name
   - Where it should be (according to Reference Layout)
   - Where it actually is (or if it's missing)

4. At the end of your analysis, provide a verification outcome:
   - CORRECT: If the Current State matches the Reference Layout exactly
   - INCORRECT: If there are any discrepancies

5. If INCORRECT, list all discrepancies in a structured format for easy tracking.
