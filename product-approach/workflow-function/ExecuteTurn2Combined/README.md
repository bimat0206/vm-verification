# ExecuteTurn2Combined

This Lambda function represents the second phase of the vending machine verification workflow. It loads the checking image, applies a prompt that references the analysis from TurnÂ 1, invokes the LLM via Bedrock and stores the results in S3 and DynamoDB.

This directory only provides a skeleton implementation to outline the intended structure. The real implementation should mirror the architecture of `ExecuteTurn1Combined` and make use of the shared packages in `workflow-function/shared`.
