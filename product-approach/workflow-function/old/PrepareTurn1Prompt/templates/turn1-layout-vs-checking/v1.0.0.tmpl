The FIRST image provided ALWAYS depicts the Reference Layout of the vending machine.

This image shows how the vending machine {{if .VendingMachineID}}{{.VendingMachineID}}{{end}}{{if .Location}} at {{.Location}}{{end}} should be arranged according to the approved planogram.

Focus exclusively on analyzing this reference layout image in detail. Your goal is to identify the exact contents of all {{.RowCount}} rows ({{.RowLabels}}) and {{.ColumnCount}} slots per row.

Important reminders:

1. Row identification is CRITICAL - Row {{index .RowLabels 0}} is ALWAYS the topmost physical shelf, Row {{index .RowLabels (add .RowCount -1)}} is ALWAYS the bottommost physical shelf.

2. Be thorough and descriptive in your analysis of each row status (Full/Partial/Empty).

3. DO NOT compare with any other image at this stage - just analyze this Reference Layout Image.

We will perform comparison with the checking image in the next step.
