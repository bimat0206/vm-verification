# Updated Changelog Entry for ExecuteTurn1

## [4.0.26] - 2025-05-24

### Fixed

* **Duplicate Output Fields Resolution:**
  * Fixed issue where function output contained duplicate `stateReferences` and `s3References` fields with identical content
  * Removed redundant `StateReferences` field from `StepFunctionOutput` struct
  * Updated all handler code to use only `S3References` for consistency across step functions
  * Eliminated duplicate field assignment that was causing JSON output bloat

* **Input Processing Simplification:**
  * Removed `StateReferences` field from `StepFunctionInput` struct
  * Simplified input validation to only process `S3References` mapping
  * Updated all reference handling code to use consistent `S3References` naming
  * Fixed compilation errors in cmd/main.go related to removed StateReferences

### Technical Details

* Removed duplicate field from StepFunctionOutput:
  ```go
  type StepFunctionOutput struct {
      S3References    *StateReferences       `json:"s3References"`
      Status          string                 `json:"status"`
      Summary         map[string]interface{} `json:"summary,omitempty"`
      Error           *schema.ErrorInfo      `json:"error,omitempty"`
  }
  ```

* Simplified input processing in handler:
  ```go
  // Map S3References to StateReferences format
  s3References := input.MapS3References()
  ```

* Updated all error handling and response creation to use S3References consistently
* Fixed all compilation errors related to removed StateReferences field

This update eliminates output duplication and ensures consistent field naming across the step function workflow, reducing JSON payload size and improving clarity.

## [4.0.25] - 2025-05-24

### Changed

* **Turn1Thinking Removal:**
  * Removed separate turn1Thinking reference from state output
  * Consolidated all thinking content into the turn1-raw-response.json file
  * Eliminated redundant S3 storage of the same content
  * Updated handler and state references to no longer track turn1Thinking separately

### Technical Details

* Removed Turn1Thinking generation from handler.go:
  ```go
  // Note: No longer saving thinking content separately as it's included in turn1-raw-response.json
  ```

* Removed Turn1Thinking field from StateReferences struct:
  ```go
  // Responses category references
  Turn1Response       *s3state.Reference  `json:"turn1Response,omitempty"`
  Turn2Response       *s3state.Reference  `json:"turn2Response,omitempty"`
  Turn2Thinking       *s3state.Reference  `json:"turn2Thinking,omitempty"`
  ```

* Ensured thinking content is included in the Turn1Response:
  ```go
  // Add thinking content if available
  if turnResponse.Metadata != nil && turnResponse.Metadata["thinking"] != nil {
      if thinkingContent, ok := turnResponse.Metadata["thinking"].(string); ok && thinkingContent != "" {
          // Add thinking to the response object
          responseMap := turn1ResponseWithThinking["response"].(map[string]interface{})
          responseMap["thinking"] = thinking
      }
  }
  ```

## [4.0.24] - 2025-05-23

  * Added proper ModelID field mapping in BedrockAdapter's Converse method
  * Ensured consistent propagation of model ID from environment variables through to API calls
  * Corrected field name case mismatch between internal types (ModelID) and shared client (ModelId)

* **S3 File Extension Duplications Resolved:**
  * Fixed issue where files were being saved with duplicate ".json.json" extensions
  * Modified all SaveToEnvelope and StoreJSON calls to trim existing .json extensions from filenames
  * Ensured consistent extension handling across all state management operations
  * Preserved correct extension handling in reference retrieval code paths

* **Thinking Content Extraction Enhancement:**
  * Completely reimplemented thinking content extraction to properly support THINKING_TYPE=enable
  * Added multiple format detection for thinking content with different tag styles
  * Implemented special case handling for various thinking content boundaries
  * Added proper token usage estimation for extracted thinking content
  * Enhanced logging for thinking extraction process to improve debuggability

### Technical Details

* Fixed model ID field in adapter:
  ```go
  // Create shared request with correct modelId field name
  sharedReq := &sharedBedrock.ConverseRequest{
      System:          req.System,
      Messages:        bedrockMessages,
      InferenceConfig: inferenceConfig,
      ModelId:         req.ModelID, // Fixed field name and added missing model ID
  }
  ```

* Fixed duplicate extensions in state saver:
  ```go
  // Save verification context without double extension
  err := s.stateManager.SaveToEnvelope(envelope, CategoryProcessing, 
      strings.TrimSuffix(FileInitialization, ".json"), state.VerificationContext)
  ```

* Implemented robust thinking extraction:
  ```go
  // Handle case where thinking type is set to "enable"
  if c.config.ThinkingType == "enable" {
      // Use a default tag structure when "enable" is specified
      return c.findThinkingContent(text, []string{
          "<thinking>", "</thinking>",
          "[thinking]", "[/thinking]",
          "Thinking:", "\n\n",
      })
  }
  ```

These updates resolve several critical issues in the ExecuteTurn1 function, ensuring proper communication with the Bedrock API, consistent file naming in S3 storage, and improved extraction of thinking content from model responses.
## [4.0.23] - 2025-05-22

### Fixed

* **Critical Bedrock API Integration Fix:**
  * Fixed critical issue where model ID was not being passed to the Bedrock API, causing "model ID cannot be empty" errors
  * Added proper ModelID field mapping in BedrockAdapter's Converse method
  * Ensured consistent propagation of model ID from environment variables through to API calls
  * Corrected field name case mismatch between internal types (ModelID) and shared client (ModelId)

### Technical Details

* Modified BedrockAdapter to properly include model ID in shared request:
  ```go
  // Create shared request with correct modelId field name
  sharedReq := &sharedBedrock.ConverseRequest{
      System:          req.System,
      Messages:        bedrockMessages,
      InferenceConfig: inferenceConfig,
      ModelId:         req.ModelID, // Fixed field name and added missing model ID
  }
  ```

* Updated ConverseRequest structure in internal/bedrock/client.go to include ModelID field:
  ```go
  type ConverseRequest struct {
      Messages        []Message
      System          string
      InferenceConfig InferenceConfig
      ModelID         string  // Added ModelID field
  }
  ```

* Ensured BuildTurn1Request sets the model ID from configuration:
  ```go
  request := &ConverseRequest{
      Messages:        bedrockMessages,
      System:          systemPrompt,
      InferenceConfig: inferenceConfig,
      ModelID:         c.config.ModelID, // Now properly passed from config
  }
  ```

This update resolves the issue where the empty model ID was preventing successful Bedrock API calls, ensuring proper communication between the Lambda function and Bedrock service when processing Turn1 verification conversations.

  * Added graceful fallbacks for missing fields rather than failing completely
  * Improved logging for clearer debugging of schema-related issues
  * Enhanced function interfaces for better type safety

### Technical Details

* Modified image processing to continue when checking image lacks Base64 data in Turn1:
  ```go
  // For checking image, only log a warning since it's not needed in Turn1
  if images.GetChecking() != nil && !images.GetChecking().HasBase64Data() {
      log.Warn("Checking image missing Base64 data, but continuing since it's not needed for Turn1", nil)
      // No error return here - we continue processing
  }
  ```

* Enhanced LoadImages to set default values for checking image:
  ```go
  // Create a minimal checking image if needed
  if images.Checking == nil && images.CheckingImage == nil {
      checkingImage := &schema.ImageInfo{
          Format: "png", // Default format
          StorageMethod: "s3-temporary",
      }
      
      images.Checking = checkingImage
      images.CheckingImage = checkingImage
  }
  ```

* Modified LoadVerificationContext to properly extract from nested structure:
  ```go
  var wrapper struct {
      VerificationContext *schema.VerificationContext `json:"verificationContext"`
      SchemaVersion       string                      `json:"schemaVersion"`
  }
  ```

* Enhanced LoadTurn1Prompt to extract Base64 references from the new structure:
  ```go
  var promptWrapper struct {
      ImageReference struct {
          ImageType string `json:"imageType"`
          Base64StorageReference struct {
              Bucket string `json:"bucket"`
              Key    string `json:"key"`
          } `json:"base64StorageReference"`
      } `json:"imageReference"`
  }
  ```

This update ensures proper compatibility with the new schema format while making the function more resilient to variations in input data, particularly understanding the different image requirements for Turn1 versus Turn2 processing.

      MessageStructure struct {
          Content []struct {
              Type string `json:"type"`
              Text string `json:"text"`
          } `json:"content"`
          Role string `json:"role"`
      } `json:"messageStructure"`
      // ...other fields...
  }
  ```

* Modified Bedrock configuration loading to handle the new location:
  ```go
  var newSystemPrompt struct {
      BedrockConfiguration struct {
          AnthropicVersion string  `json:"anthropicVersion"`
          MaxTokens        int     `json:"maxTokens"`
          // ...other fields...
      } `json:"bedrockConfiguration"`
  }
  ```

* Updated response saving to include thinking content directly in the same file:
  ```go
  turn1ResponseWithThinking := map[string]interface{}{
      // ...other fields...
      "response": map[string]interface{}{
          "content": ...,
          "thinking": thinkingContent
      }
  }
  ```

This update ensures compatibility with the updated schema format while maintaining backward compatibility with existing workflows.

  ```go
  type StepFunctionInput struct {
      StateReferences *StateReferences               `json:"stateReferences"`
      S3References    map[string]*s3state.Reference  `json:"s3References"` // Changed to map structure
      VerificationId  string                         `json:"verificationId"`
      // ...
  }
  ```

* Added mapping function to convert reference formats:
  ```go
  func (input *StepFunctionInput) MapS3References() *StateReferences {
      // Maps dynamic keys like "processing_initialization" to structured fields
      // ...
  }
  ```

* Updated handler to use new mapping approach:
  ```go
  if input.StateReferences == nil {
      input.StateReferences = input.MapS3References()
  }
  ```

* Enhanced state loader to handle partially mapped references and create default values when needed

  // Required references - critical for functionality
  if refs.Initialization == nil {
      missingRefs = append(missingRefs, "Initialization (processing_initialization)")
  }
  
  // Optional references - log warnings but don't fail validation
  if refs.ImageMetadata == nil {
      optionalMissing = append(optionalMissing, "ImageMetadata (images_metadata)")
  }
  ```

This update resolves the incompatibility issue between the Step Function input format and the Lambda's expected reference structure, ensuring proper handling of state references throughout the verification workflow.

## [4.0.19] - 2025-05-21

### Technical Details

* Added `S3References` field to both input and output structs in `types.go`
* Modified the handler to check and use either field:
  ```go
  if input.StateReferences == nil && input.S3References == nil {
      return nil, wferrors.NewValidationError("Neither StateReferences nor S3References is provided", nil)
  }
  if input.StateReferences == nil {
      input.StateReferences = input.S3References
  }
  ```
* Updated response creation to populate both fields consistently:
  ```go
  if output.StateReferences != nil {
      output.S3References = output.StateReferences
  }
  ```
