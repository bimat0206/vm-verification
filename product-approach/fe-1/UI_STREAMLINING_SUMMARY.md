# UI Streamlining Summary - Initiate Verification Page

## Overview
Successfully streamlined the Initiate Verification page UI to create a clean, focused interface that guides users through the image selection process without overwhelming them with options and information.

## Problems Addressed

### 1. **Visual Clutter**
**Before**: Too many controls, buttons, and information displayed simultaneously
**After**: Clean, organized layout with progressive disclosure of advanced features

### 2. **Information Overload**
**Before**: Debug info, detailed error messages, and technical details prominently displayed
**After**: Essential information visible, technical details hidden in collapsible sections

### 3. **Workflow Confusion**
**Before**: Secondary features (pagination, search, view options) competed for attention with primary task
**After**: Primary task (selecting images) is prominent, secondary features are accessible but not distracting
