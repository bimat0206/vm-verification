# Status API Refactoring Notes

## Overview
The status API has been refactored to fix the DynamoDB endpoint resolution issue and improve overall code structure.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Fixed DynamoDB Endpoint Resolution Issue
- **Problem**: The error "not found, ResolveEndpointV2" was caused by AWS SDK v2 module version incompatibility issues (as documented in [GitHub issue #2370](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/issues/2370))
- **Solution**: 
  - Used `BaseEndpoint` option to explicitly set the DynamoDB endpoint URL
  - Removed complex custom endpoint resolvers in favor of simple BaseEndpoint configuration
  - Added explicit region configuration with multiple fallback options
  - Added custom retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Simplified AWS configuration to avoid endpoint resolution conflicts

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Added context-based timeouts for all AWS operations
- Implemented retry logic for transient errors
- Better error classification (retryable vs non-retryable)
- More descriptive error messages for debugging

### 3. Code Structure Improvements
- Separated initialization logic into dedicated functions
- Better separation of concerns
- Improved logging with structured fields
- Added proper resource cleanup with defer statements

### 4. Configuration Enhancements
- Better environment variable handling with fallbacks
- Region configuration now checks AWS_REGION, REGION, and AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
- Defaults to us-east-1 if no region is specified

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- Added connection pooling with custom HTTP client
- Implemented request timeouts to prevent hanging
- Better resource management

## Environment Variables
The API expects the following environment variables:
- `DYNAMODB_VERIFICATION_TABLE` (required)
- `DYNAMODB_CONVERSATION_TABLE` (required)
- `STATE_BUCKET` (optional)
- `STEP_FUNCTIONS_STATE_MACHINE_ARN` (optional)
- `AWS_REGION` or `REGION` or `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` (optional, defaults to us-east-1)
- `LOG_LEVEL` (optional, defaults to info)

## Testing
To test the refactored API:
1. Ensure all required environment variables are set
2. Deploy using the existing deploy.sh script
3. Test with a known verification ID

## Rollback
If needed, the original implementation is backed up as `main.go.backup`
