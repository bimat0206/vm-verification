The FIRST image provided ALWAYS depicts the **Previous Layout** of the vending machine.

This image shows the actual state of the machine before any changes.

Focus exclusively on analyzing this Previous Layout image in detail. Your goals are to:

1. **STRUCTURE DETECTION**  
   - Detect how many physical **rows** (shelves) the machine has and how many **slots per row**.  
   - Label rows in strict top-to-bottom order (Row A = topmost, Row B = second from top, etc.) and slots left-to-right (01, 02, 03, etc.).
   - Confirm by stating:  
     “I have detected **X rows** (A–[LAST_ROW]) and **Y slots per row** (01–[MAX_SLOT]).”

2. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - For each detected row, determine its status (**Full/Partial/Empty**).  
   - For every slot, describe the exact contents (product type, color, packaging, brand if legible) or note “Empty (coils visible).”

3. **IMPORTANT REMINDERS**  
   - Row labels are based **only** on physical shelf order, not on product appearance.  
   - Use two-digit slot numbers (01, 02, 03, etc.).
   - **DO NOT** compare to any other image at this stage—focus solely on the Previous Layout.

We will analyze the Current Layout image and perform the comparison in the next step.
