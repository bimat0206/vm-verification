## [1.1.3] - 2025-05-11

### Fixed
- Added explicit handling in the `Process` method to ensure that `previousVerificationId` field is always set for `PREVIOUS_VS_CURRENT` verification type, even if not provided in the request
- Fixed Step Function error: `JSONPath '$.verificationContext.previousVerificationId' could not be found in the input`
- Enhanced logging to track state of `previousVerificationId` field throughout processing

## [1.1.2] - 2025-05-11

### Fixed
- Removed `omitempty` JSON tag from `PreviousVerificationId` field in the `VerificationContext` struct to ensure it's always included in the JSON output
- Added enhanced logging to track the serialization and presence of the `previousVerificationId` field
- Fixed Step Function error: `JSONPath '$.verificationContext.previousVerificationId' could not be found in the input`

## [1.1.1] - 2025-05-09

### Fixed
- Fixed "failed to parse event: failed to parse event detail: unexpected end of JSON input" error when invoked from Step Functions
- Enhanced input parsing to properly extract top-level requestId and requestTimestamp fields when verificationContext is present
- Improved error logging with more detailed JSON content for debugging

## [1.1.0] - 2025-05-08

### Changed
- Made `previousVerificationId` and `vendingMachineId` optional for `PREVIOUS_VS_CURRENT` verification type
- Updated validation logic in `service.go` to remove requirement for `previousVerificationId` in `PREVIOUS_VS_CURRENT` type
- Ensured alignment between API Gateway model, Step Function state machine, and function validation

### Fixed
- Fixed potential validation error when `PREVIOUS_VS_CURRENT` verification requests don't include `previousVerificationId`

## [1.0.0] - 2025-04-20

### Added
- Initial implementation of InitializeFunction
- Support for two verification types: `LAYOUT_VS_CHECKING` and `PREVIOUS_VS_CURRENT`
- Validation for required fields based on verification type
- Resource validation for images and layouts
- Historical context retrieval for `PREVIOUS_VS_CURRENT` verification type
- DynamoDB integration for storing verification records
- S3 integration for validating image existence
