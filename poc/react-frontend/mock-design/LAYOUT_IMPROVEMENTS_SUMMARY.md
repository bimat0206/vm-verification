3. **Test the layout features**:
   - Switch between "Checking Bucket" and "Reference Bucket" modes
   - Test file drag and drop functionality
   - Verify responsive behavior by resizing the browser
   - Check the S3 path browser in Reference mode
   - Test the upload history tab

4. **Visual verification**:
   - Confirm gradient colors match the specification
   - Verify glassmorphism effects are visible
   - Check font rendering (Inter/Manrope)
