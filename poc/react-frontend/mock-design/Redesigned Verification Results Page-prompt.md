LLM Prompt for UI/UX Redesign: "Verification Results" Dashboard v2Your Role: You are an expert UI/UX designer and front-end developer tasked with executing a major redesign of a data-heavy "Verification Results" page. Your focus is on creating a highly functional, ergonomic, and visually striking interface.Project: Redesign the "Verification Results" page.The "Before" State: The page has a simple layout that is not optimized for a dashboard. The filters and results are in a single flow, making it difficult to keep controls in view while scrolling. It lacks advanced features for image inspection and a professional, consistent layout.The "After" State (Your Goal): Your task is to implement a complete redesign based on the following specifications. The new design features a collapsible two-column layout, a consistent page header, advanced image viewing capabilities, and the "Gradient Shift" theme.1. Core UX & Layout TransformationMain Page Structure:The page must begin with a large, centered main title ("Verification Results") and a descriptive subtitle, both styled according to the theme.Implement a two-column primary layout.Left Column (Sidebar): A sticky sidebar containing all user controls. This sidebar must be collapsible.Right Column (Main Content): An area dedicated to a toggle button and the list of verification results. This area must expand to full-width when the sidebar is collapsed.Sidebar Toggle:Place a single button at the top-left of the main content area (to the right of the sidebar).This button will toggle the visibility of the entire left sidebar.Results Display:Display results in a compact table format.The pagination controls and results count (e.g., "Showing 1-5 of 57 results") must be located at the top of the results table.Detail View:Clicking "View Details" on a result must open a large modal window.This modal must feature a two-column layout for details and image comparison.Crucially, the "LLM Analysis" text area within the modal must be designed to handle large blocks of text by becoming vertically scrollable if the content exceeds a maximum height, without breaking the modal's layout.2. Visual Style Guide: "Gradient Shift" ThemeColor Palette:Primary Background: Near Black (#111111)Secondary Background (Cards, Modals, Sidebar): Dark Gray (#1E1E1E)Primary Text: Off-White (#F5F5F5)Secondary Text (Labels): Light Gray (#A0A0A0)Borders: Medium Gray (#2F2F2F)Primary Accent (Gradient): A linear gradient from Blue (#3B82F6) -> Purple (#8B5CF6) -> Magenta (#EC4899).Glassmorphism: The sticky left sidebar should have a semi-transparent dark background (e.g., rgba(30, 30, 30, 0.6)) with a backdrop-blur effect.Gradient Application: Use the Primary Accent Gradient for the main title, primary buttons, and other key highlights.3. Component-by-Component ImplementationA. Filter Panel (Left Sidebar):This component should contain a "Quick Lookup" section and a "Filters & Sorting" section.Remove all internal expand/collapse toggles from these sections. They should always be visible when the sidebar is open.Add a "Results per page" dropdown within the "Filters & Sorting" section. It must include options for 5 (default), 10, 15, and 20.B. Image Comparison (Inside Modal):Each of the two images (Reference and Checking) must have a loading state. Display an animated spinner or placeholder while the image loads to prevent layout shifts.Add a "View Full Screen" button below the side-by-side image comparison.C. Full-Screen Image Viewer (New Component):This component opens as a full-screen modal when the "View Full Screen" button is clicked.It must display the reference and checking images side-by-side, filling the screen.Implement Zoom and Pan functionality:Zoom: Users must be able to use their mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the images.Pan: Users must be able to click and drag with their mouse to pan around the zoomed images.Include a clear "Close" button and instruct the user that the ESC key also closes the viewer.4. Final DeliverableProvide a single, complete, and self-contained React component (.jsx) that implements this entire redesigned page. Use functional components with hooks and state management (e.g., useState, useEffect). All styling must be achieved using Tailwind CSS classes. The code should be clean, well-commented, and robust, with special attention paid to the state management for the collapsible sidebar and the interactive full-screen image viewer.
